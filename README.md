Object-Oriented Arcade in Java
Welcome to the Object-Oriented Arcade, a Java-based project that showcases the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This arcade incorporates abstract classes and demonstrates each of the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

Games Included:
Coin Toss: A simple yet engaging game where the user can simulate a coin toss.

Pet Trainer: Train and interact with a virtual pet, demonstrating the principles of encapsulation.

RockPaperScissors: Classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game with the option for both single and double-player modes. The implementation showcases the concept of polymorphism.

TicTacToe: A timeless Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring a CPU opponent for both single and double-player experiences. This game demonstrates the use of abstract classes and inheritance.

Features:
Abstract Classes: Utilized abstract classes to create a modular and extensible design for the games.

Single and Double Player Modes: Implemented CPU opponents in RockPaperScissors and TicTacToe, providing users with both single and double-player options.
